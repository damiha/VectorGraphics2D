# 2D Vector Graphics

A small vector-based graphics program (similar to Inkscape).
I just wanted to know to try out Bézier curves and splines.
Maybe I'll extend the program by other spline types (B-Splines, Catmull-Rom, Hermite)
in the future :)

### Features

- create curves (Bézier splines)
- edit / move the curves around
- fill curves
- linking neighboring handles to ensure smoothness (C1-continuity)

**NOTE**: You cannot save your drawings as .svg files as of know. There also
is no layer system like in Photoshop or Gimp.

### Demo

**NOTE**: The weird yellow color effect is a result of converting the
.mp4 video to a GIF using kdenlive
